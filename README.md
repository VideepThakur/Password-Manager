# üîê Password Manager Application (Java + Swing)

A secure and modern Java-based Password Manager with GUI built using **Swing**. This application allows you to securely store website credentials (website, username, and encrypted password) protected by AES encryption and a master password.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Master Password Setup**
  - On first launch, prompts to **set a master password**.
  - On subsequent launches, the user must enter the correct master password (verified via SHA-256 hash).

- üîê **AES Encryption**
  - All passwords are encrypted with AES using a key derived from the master password via PBKDF2.
  - The full password storage (`passwords.dat`) is encrypted and serialized securely.

- üíæ **Persistent Encrypted Storage**
  - Stores all entries (website, username, encrypted password) in `passwords.dat` (AES encrypted).
  - Master password hash is stored in `config.dat`.

- ‚ûï **Manage Credentials**
  - Add, retrieve, and delete website credentials via the GUI.

- üì§ **Export Options**
  - Export all passwords (decrypted) to:
    - `export.json` (pretty printed)
    - `export.csv` (comma-separated values)
